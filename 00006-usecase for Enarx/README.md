## Summary 
This document is used to introdue Enarx to different scenarios especially which have standards or universal architecture that can be referenced.
## Motivation
Since confidential computing is an emerging concept and solution for protecting data in use, it is crutial that this project can provide some convincing and instructional usecase to introduce to different industries. And these usecases can also promote the design of Enarx to fulfill general uses.
## Scenarios
### Scenario 1: MEC(Multi-access edge computing) with Enarx
In the MEC scenario, the edge computing infrastructure is deployed at the edge of network consumer. 
For example, an MEC device could be deployed together with UPF(User Plain Function) beside a factory to support low latency applications. In this situation, both the factory and the operator want to make sure the edge computing environment is secure. Enarx could be used to provide remote attestation and trust execution environment, tbc
